# Fluorescence / Microbial Detection Using CNN & Random Forest
## Project Overview
This project focuses on automated quantitative detection using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Random Forest classifiers.
The goal is to process fluorescence microscopy images (or other kind of image data) and classify whether a sample image contains desired element (fluorescence intensity / bacteria) or not.

The CNN is trained on synthetic image data, learning to distinguish microbial content based on intensity, patterns and unique morphological features.
A Random Forest model is used as an alternative classifier to compare performance and explore feature-based learning.
